# Summary

The 'Ayurvedic Herb Explorer' is an open-source, interactive web application designed to make classical Ayurvedic pharmacology accessible and explorable for modern researchers, students, and practitioners. The software provides a clean, responsive, and powerful interface to search, filter, and compare over 700 herbs from the *Amidha Ayurveda Open Herb Database* [@varshney_sparsh_2025_herb_database]. Users can perform complex queries based on classical properties (Rasa, Guna, Virya, Vipaka, Dosha Karma, and Prabhava), save favorites, and compare herbs side-by-side. Built as a standalone JavaScript, HTML, and CSS application, it runs entirely in the browser without requiring any backend or installation, ensuring maximum accessibility and ease of use.

# Statement of Need

Classical Ayurvedic knowledge, particularly the properties of medicinal herbs (Dravyaguna), is vast but often siloed within texts or fragmented across proprietary, non-standardized digital formats. This creates a significant barrier for computational research, education, and comparative analysis. While open-source datasets like the *Amidha Ayurveda Open Herb Database* [@varshney_sparsh_2025_herb_database] have begun to standardize this knowledge, there has been a lack of accessible, citable, and open-source *tools* to interact with this data.

The 'Ayurvedic Herb Explorer' directly addresses this gap. It serves as the primary, user-friendly interface for this dataset, enabling researchers to answer complex questions (e.g., "List all herbs with Tikta (Bitter) Rasa and Sheeta (Cooling) Virya that pacify the Pitta dosha") in seconds.

This software is part of a larger ecosystem of open-source tools for Digital Ayurveda, alongside projects like *Shloka AI* [@varshney_shloka_ai] and *Siddhant Kosha* [@varshney_siddhant_kosha]. By providing a testable, citable, and extensible tool for exploring herb properties, the 'Ayurvedic Herb Explorer' aims to lower the barrier to entry for digital research in Ayurveda and support a more open, reproducible, and data-driven approach to the field.
